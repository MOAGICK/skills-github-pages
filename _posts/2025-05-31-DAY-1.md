On today's blog titled "DAY-1", we learn the skill of creating a blog, atop of the various skills learned thanks to the maintainer month security challenge which introduced me to GitHub, repository management, supply chain security and code scanning.

More to be documented as we progress and go through many of these skills exercise.

###### stay tuned.
